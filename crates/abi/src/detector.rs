//! The [`Detector`] port and the keyless mock detector.
//!
//! `Detector` is the one abstraction a host drives: text in, [`Verdict`] out.
//! The Phase-3 wasmtime runtime will implement it as a `WasmDetector`; the [`mock`] module
//! implements it natively so the whole Phase-1 pipeline runs with no runtime — and so the
//! native path and the wasm artifact share **identical** rule code (P3.4 proves they agree
//! through wasmtime).

use crate::Verdict;

/// Something that runs detection over text and returns a cited [`Verdict`].
///
/// The single seam every surface drives. Detection is a pure function of the input for a given
/// detector — no clocks, no randomness, no I/O — so the same input always yields the same
/// verdict.

/// It exists so every command, test, and demo runs offline with no model and no wasm runtime,
/// and so the native path and the wasm artifact share the exact same rule code. It is a
/// fixture, never a real guardrail.
