//! `agent-channel`, the host↔guest wire protocol for the exec channel.
//!
//! One command in, its `stdout`/`stderr`/exit out, over a single bidirectional byte stream (vsock
//! in the guest, a unix socket in tests, the protocol doesn't care). The transport is chosen in
//! ADR 002; this crate is only the framing, so it stays dependency-free
//! and unit-testable without a VM.
//!
//! **Shape (why it's built this way).**
//! - A **handshake** first: a 4-byte magic + a `u16` version. Both peers *send then receive*, so a
//!   version skew between a separately-built host and guest agent fails fast and clearly instead of
//!   mis-parsing later. New message types are added as new tags (the enums are `#[non_exhaustive]`),
//!   so the two halves can evolve without a lockstep release.
//! - Every message is a **length-prefixed frame**, `tag(u8) · len(u32-le) · payload`, never a
//!   read-to-EOF or a delimiter scan. `len` is checked against [`MAX_PAYLOAD`] *before* allocating,
//!   so a hostile or buggy peer cannot drive an unbounded read (the same discipline as the HTTP
//!   client in `agent-vmm`). Every failure is a typed [`ChannelError`] carrying its `io::Error`
//!   source; nothing here panics.
//!
//! **The API is type-state, not free functions.** [`ClientConnection`] (host) and
//! [`ServerConnection`] (guest) each perform the handshake on construction and then expose only
//! their role's operations, a client sends a [`Request`] and reads [`Response`]s ending in
//! [`Response::Exit`]/[`Response::Error`]; a server does the mirror. You cannot send a message
//! before the handshake, and a client cannot `recv_request`; the raw codec is internal. **Liveness
//! is the transport's job**: set read/write deadlines on the stream before constructing, so a
//! stalled peer becomes a typed [`ChannelError::Io`] timeout rather than a hang.
