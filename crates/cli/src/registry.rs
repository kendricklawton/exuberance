//! The adapter registry — the **one place** a data provider, AI model, or coding agent is named.
//!
//! This is what makes exuberance a pluggable, multi-vendor engine: the config resolves a *name*
//! (`"mock"`, `"massive"`, `"claude"`, `"claude-code"`, …) and the registry maps it to a boxed trait object
//! the engine drives. Adding a vendor is a new adapter crate + one arm here — nothing in the core or the
//! screens changes. The [`catalog`] lists every intended vendor and whether it's wired yet, so
//! `exub providers` shows the plug-in matrix at a glance.
